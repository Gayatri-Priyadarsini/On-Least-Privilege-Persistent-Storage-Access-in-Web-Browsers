## Code changes to be done
- We have highlighted the code to be added/changed by encapsulating the lines in "//Code changes/////" strings.
- Some files just declare the flags and related functions. They can be searched and added individually. The additional cookie attibutes are: "TPaccess" and "FirstPartyJSOnly".
- We have also introduced an additional header as well called the Third-Party-JS-Header.
