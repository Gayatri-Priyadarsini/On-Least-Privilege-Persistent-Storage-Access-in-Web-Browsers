## Code changes to be done
- We have highlighted the code to be added/changed by encapsulating the lines in "//Code changes/////" strings.
- Some files just declare the flags and related functions. They can be searched and added individually. The additional flags are: "Raccess" and "Waccess" and "RWallowed".
